My [Playable Codex](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827187144) mod is riddled with balancing &amp; general issues, so I plan to remake it, starting by a complete rework of the skill tree.


## Skill tree {#skill-tree}

The trees as they are now (2025-12-27) are not really thought out, the new ones are as follow :


### Teleporter {#teleporter}

Focuses on teleport, damage mitigation and other tricks to redirect damages


### Codex Factory {#codex-factory}

Focuses on cloning, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers


### Run n gun {#run-n-gun}

Focuses on straight shooting and taking out enemies with it's precision rifle


## Skill tree {#skill-tree}

Each new abilities will have a footnote detailing how it works

## Units {#units}

-   Decoys : work like a mimic beacon
-   Free clone : Half HP, other stats are the same, they can create clones themselves but cannot use any special abilities (inherit blast padding and other such abilities if the original has them)
-   Enhanced clones : 10HP, 15 mobility, 10 dodge, can create lesser clones and use a lesser form of psionic rift. Due to the amount, they don't have any real guns and can only use a "codex gun" that deal 5 damage
-   Lesser clones : 3HP, 17 mobility, 5 dodge, they can use a minor form of teleport, the gun they have does 2 damage

[^fn:1]: The codex gain immunity to poison, mind control, fire and other biological attacks
[^fn:2]: Free action teleporting the unit in a small (5x5) range (4 turn cooldown)
[^fn:3]: Make each cloning only consume 25% of the health
[^fn:4]: A rift that unload all weapons in its radius, if units stay in the rift, they take damage
[^fn:5]: Swap places with either an ally or enemy (1AP, 2 turn cooldown, does not end the turn, does not require line of sight)
[^fn:6]: Each clones get +15 aim, +1 mobility and +10 dodge, the clone also get 1 action point when being cloned

[^fn:8]: Create a free clone, 1AP, 3 turn cooldown, 3 charges
[^fn:9]: Teleporting has its cooldown reduced by half and its range increased, also grant a boost to stat after a teleport (10 aim, 1 armour, 10 defense), psionic rift also gets its cooldown reduced by 2, radius increased by 2 and damage increased by 4
[^fn:10]: The codex create a decoy, taking 10% of its total health, every units is compeled to shoot at the decoy, the decoy has 15 health, 1 armour, cannot move or attack and dissapear after a turn, 2 use, 5 turn cooldown, 1AP, does not end the turn
[^fn:11]: Teleport briefly in another dimension, making the attack miss (passive, can trigger at most 2 times per turn, grant 30 dodge as well)
[^fn:12]: Clones now don't damage the codex (the decoy now takes 5% of health, rounded up)
[^fn:13]: Has a chance to desorient or stun a target, remove all ammo and makes the unit unable to move (6 turns cooldown, 1AP, end the turn, stun for 4 actions, desorient for 6, 50/50% chances for both)
[^fn:14]: Teleport near a unit (3x3 around), grant a single action point to attack said unit 3 times (gives 200% damage), get teleported back to the starting point (8 turn cooldown, 1AP, end turn)
[^fn:15]: The codex create 5 enhanced clones in a 10x10 radius, each ones have 10HP, 2 armour, 15 mobility, 10 dodge, they can each create 2 lesser clones, due to the strain, the main codex is rendered stunned for 3 turns
