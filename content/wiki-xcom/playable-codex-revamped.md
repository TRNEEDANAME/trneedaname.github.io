My [Playable Codex](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827187144) mod is riddled with balancing &amp; general issues, so I plan to remake it, starting by a complete rework of the skill tree.
They'll focus on a gimmick of the unit, making that particularity better and more fun to use.

The class isn't balanced for vanilla at all, but it can be made so


## Skill tree {#skill-tree}

The trees as they are now (2025-12-27) are not really thought out, the new ones are as follow :


### Teleporter {#teleporter}

Focuses on teleport, damage mitigation and other tricks to redirect damages


### Codex Factory {#codex-factory}

Focuses on cloning, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers


### Run n gun {#run-n-gun}

Focuses on straight shooting and taking out enemies with it's precision rifle


## Skill tree {#skill-tree}

Each new abilities will have a footnote detailing how it works
