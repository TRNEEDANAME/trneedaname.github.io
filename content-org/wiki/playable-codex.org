My [[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827187144][Playable Codex]] mod is riddled with balancing & general issues, so I plan to remake it, starting by a complete rework of the skill tree.

** Skill tree

The trees as they are now (2025-12-27) are not really thought out, the new ones are as follow :

*** Teleporter

Focuses on teleport, damage mitigation and other tricks to redirect damages

*** Codex Factory

Focuses on cloning, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers

*** Run n gun

Focuses on straight shooting and taking out enemies with it's precision rifle

** Skill tree

Each new abilities will have a footnote detailing how it works
