The resistance in Xcom is, in the lore at least, very capable, they hold ADVENT at bay for a while (mostly by hiding but it works).

In game however, they are supersoldiers and the worst rookies ever at the same time.

They have better accuracy than your soldiers on the first retaliation mission and could defend themselves without you, after a while however, they become useless because their gear and AI never evolve.
