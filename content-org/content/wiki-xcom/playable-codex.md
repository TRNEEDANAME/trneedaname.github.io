My [Playable Codex](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827187144) mod is riddled with balancing &amp; general issues, so I plan to remake it, starting by a complete rework of the skill tree


## Skill tree {#skill-tree}

The trees as they are now (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2025-12-27 sam.&gt;</span></span>) are not really thought out, the new ones are as follow :


### Teleporter {#teleporter}

Focuses on teleport, damage mitigation and other tricks to redirect damages


### Codex Factory {#codex-factory}

Focuses on cloning, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers


### Run n gun {#run-n-gun}

Focuses on straight shooting and taking out enemies with it's precision rifle

| Rank       | Teleporter      | Codex Factory | Run n Gun     |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Squaddie   | Teleport[^fn:1] | Clone         | Blast Padding |
| Corporal   |                 |               |               |
| Sergeant   |                 |               |               |
| Lieutenant |                 |               |               |
| Captain    |                 |               |               |
| Major      |                 |               |               |
| Colonel    |                 |               |               |
